            <p>Welcome to the most awaited hackathon where you can flex your skills overnight!! The main theme of the hackathon is to create a telegram and discord bot where you can pick one. Since it is an overnight event, we expect you to bring real-life solutions or something that appeals to the millennial generation. </p>

            <p>Hackathon doesn't sound fun without bonuses and presets. We will be providing you with the telegram and discord-sdk and also if you are more into AR/VR you can add your own creativity where we will give you the leverage to take 3D presets from mixamo. If you are a great multitasker you can create your 3D models in spline as well. These are just the starting presets that we'll provide you. You'll be also given bonus points for your AR/VR creativity.</p>
